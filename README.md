# Scene Staging

In the future s&box will have a scene system. You will add GameObjects that contain Components to the scene.

This repository is the staging area for this system. S&box is evolving to the point where we can put a whole game engine, unit tests and editor system in one game project.

- Support Scene Prefabs in Hammer
- Evaluate and Create Components
- Move Scene stuff to engine
- Make Scene system preferred way to develop
- Retire APIs that are covered by
